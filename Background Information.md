Background Information

As the volume of data on the internet continues to grow exponentially, the need for efficient storage, access, and processing of this information becomes increasingly critical. 
Traditional data structures, such as arrays, provide a means for data storage, but their search time complexity of O(log n) can result in significant inefficiencies for large datasets. 
To address this challenge, the hashing data structure was developed, which allows for constant-time storage and retrieval of data (O(1)).
Hashing plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in the realm of data encryption. The core components of hashing include the key, hash function, and hash table. 
The key, typically a string or integer, serves as input to the hash function, which then generates a unique index, or hash index, for storage in the hash table. 
This specialized data structure enables the efficient mapping of keys to values, facilitating a wide range of encryption applications that demand fast and secure data storage and retrieval.
